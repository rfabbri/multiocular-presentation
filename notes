II) second, math

- eng reversa, validacao de processos de fabricacao, do modelo construido vs
  projetado, controle de qualidade (solar panel)
-  artists sculpt physical models of what they want and scan them into digital form rather than directly creating digital models on a computer.

 It is, for example, a very complex task to assemble a modern car, since it consists of many parts that must fit together at the very end of the production line. The optimal performance of this process is guaranteed by quality assurance systems. Especially the geometry of the metal parts must be checked in order to assure that they have the correct dimensions, fit together and finally work reliably.
